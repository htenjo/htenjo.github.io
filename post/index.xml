      <description>Git commands For sure there are a lot of additional git commands, weird configurations, or more robust cheat sheets everywhere but this is my own compilation, these are most of the commands I&amp;rsquo;ve required on a daily basis organized and with a description easy to understand for future reference.
For different command options, I&amp;rsquo;ll use ::: to avoid confusion with semicolons or other characters.
Configuration commands    Type Description Command     Config Configure vscode as default git editor $ git config --global core.</description>

      <description>Understanding the differences between JMS &amp;amp; AMQP In the site Understanding the differences between JMS &amp;amp; AMQP, Mark Richards explains in detail what AMQP is and how it is different from JMS.
In a few words:
 AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is the de facto standard for those outside of JVM ecosystem (those who can&amp;rsquo;t use JMS) with more ways to interact between publishers and subscribers and with the additional infrastructure required to decouple the integration between them.</description>

      <description>I tried multiple times to create a blog and publish things constantly but I failed each time. I usually started with a lot of enthusiasm but the tools used to create and publish content, always were boring and tedious for me to don&amp;rsquo;t say complex. I tried WordPress because everyone says it&amp;rsquo;s the best CMS but It&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming the number of pluggings, configurations, deployment, and so on, it&amp;rsquo;s overkill for a simple blog like this one.</description>
